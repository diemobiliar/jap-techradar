        <h2>What is the Tech Radar?</h2>
          <p>
            The JAP Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
              assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
              scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our JAP production environment, low risk and recommended to be
              widely used.</li>
            <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
              real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
              technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
              technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
              technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will
              find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have
              started a prototyping effort.</li>
            <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that
              we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
              but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>What is the purpose?</h2>
          <p>
            The JAP Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support the engineering teams working with JAP to select the
            best technologies for new projects. It offers the opportunity to share knowledge and experience with
            technologies, to think about technology decisions and to continuously develop our technology landscape. The
            TechRadar is intended to represent the changes that we think all JAP teams should observe and use in their
            projects. It is based on the <em>Thoughtworks</em> Tech Radar, modified by Die Mobiliar AG in 2022.
          </p>

          <h2>How do we maintain it?</h2>
          <p>
            The data points are evaluated and updated at regular intervals in collaboration with the technology architects. The code
            basis of the radar is also updated in this rhythm.
